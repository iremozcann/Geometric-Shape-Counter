# Geometric-Shape-Counter
In this project, GUI is designed that automatically detects the type of geometric shapes in an image and count the number, perimeters, and areas of each shape.

- The algorithm could use a combination of image processing techniques such as thresholding, edge detection, and contour detection to identify and count the number of geometric shapes in the image. Once the shapes are identified, their count can be displayed in the text field using the setPlainText method of the QTextEdit widget. The script uses the OpenCV library for image processing, the PyQt5 library for building the GUI, and the imutils library for resizing the image.

## GUI Application

- You can upload the image you want by clicking the "Select Image" button. 
- When you press the "Geometric Shape Counter" button, it shows the area, perimeter, and type of the image you selected. It also prints how many of each shape is in the image

**NOTE:** There are some image samples for the application in the folder named Images. You can also upload any extra images you want here before running the project.
